This project is a dashboard of passing visualizations of NFL quarterbacks meant to provide the tools for an indepth analysis of a player's game. It uses data from the Big Data Bowl 2025 and creates a select list of quarterbacks from the dataset, and a list of plats in which they threw the ball. There is a basic animation of all the players movement during the play, along with a highlighted ball. Player dots can be selected and have their names shown as well as a trace for their movement. The bottom two plots display the quarterback's pass locations, the result of that pass, and a heatmap of their completions.
