# Data Visualization Portfolio

## About Me
Welcome to my data visualization portfolio! This collection showcases projects that reflect both my technical skills in data analysis and my passion for football. Throughout my data visualization course, I focused on NFL-related topics, aiming to turn complex data into clear, compelling insights. These projects represent work I genuinely enjoyed, and I hope they serve as a stepping stone toward a future in sports analytics.
