 - Include a large image of your visualization ```![image alt text](image_file.png)```

This project is a dashboard of passing visualizations of NFL quarterbacks meant to provide the tools for an indepth analysis of a player's game. It uses data from the Big Data Bowl 2025.
It currently uses 1 week of game data but will be expanded in the future. I used Python and Plotly to create the dashboard, along with a number of other packages (Pandas, Kaggles' API, etc.). Please note that since the dataset is so large it must be downloaded from the Big Data Bowl Kaggle page, this code will check for it downloaded, though you will need a Kaggle API key to do so.
