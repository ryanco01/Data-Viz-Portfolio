# Passing Heatmaps
img src="./Images/Project3.png" alt="3"

This project was inspired by reddit user RJ7002 and their passing heatmap. [Found here] (https://nflpassinganalyzer.streamlit.app/). Once I recreated the maps as closely as I could, I enhanced and altered
some of its features in a way I felt better suited the data. This included changing colors of points and the plots, to splitting up the heatmaps to show completions/incompletions.
