This project was inspired by reddit user RJ7002 and their passing heatmap. [Found here] (https://nflpassinganalyzer.streamlit.app/). Once I recreated the maps as closely as I could, I enhanced and altered
some of its features in a way I felt better suited the data. This included changing colors of points and the plots, to splitting up the heatmaps to show completions/incompletions. This chart shows Kylar Murray's passes during the 2019 season during a week 9 game.
